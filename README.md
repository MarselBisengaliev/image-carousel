# Image-Carousel


## The JavaScript:
- DOM manipulations
- control structures
- functions.


## About this project:
<p>I was interested in learning how to create this kind of thing. First we use CSS to block all the images. Then we use JavaScript to change the CSS styles, releasing one image at a time.</p>

<p>Before working on this project, I wasn't sure if it was possible to use JS to change CSS styles directly, but it turned out to be possible.</p>
